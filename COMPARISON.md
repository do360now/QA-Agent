## Key Differences Explained

### 1. Deployment Model

**Propolis:**
- Cloud-based SaaS
- Access via web dashboard
- Zero installation
- Managed infrastructure

**Your System:**
- Self-hosted on your machines
- Command-line interface
- Requires setup (Python, Ollama, etc.)
- You manage resources

**Best for you?** Local system, because your app is network-restricted.

### 2. Data Privacy & Security

**Propolis:**
- Your app URL goes to their servers
- Test data processed in cloud
- Credentials stored remotely
- Screenshots/traces stored externally

**Your System:**
- Everything stays on your network
- No external data transfer
- Credentials never leave your infrastructure
- Complete audit trail

**Best for you?** Local system, especially for sensitive internal apps.

### 3. Cost Structure

**Propolis:**
- Subscription model
- Per-test or tier-based pricing
- Typical: $500-2000+/month
- Scales with usage

**Your System:**
- One-time setup effort
- No recurring fees
- Hardware costs only
- Run unlimited tests

**Example:**
- 20 tests/month on Propolis: ~$1000/month = $12,000/year
- Your system: $0/year after setup

### 4. Customization

**Propolis:**
- Fixed agent behavior
- Standard bug detection
- Limited configuration
- Can't modify LLM prompts

**Your System:**
- Full source code access
- Custom bug detectors
- Adjustable agent behavior
- Modify LLM prompts
- Add integrations as needed

**Example customizations you can make:**
```python
# Check for your company's specific error patterns
async def _check_company_errors(self, page):
    if await page.query_selector('.company-error-widget'):
        return {'type': 'company_specific_error', ...}

# Use custom LLM prompts for your domain
prompt = f"""
You are testing our e-commerce checkout flow.
Pay special attention to payment forms and cart calculations.
Always verify prices sum correctly.
"""
```

### 5. Access to Internal Apps

**Propolis:**
- ❌ Cannot access apps behind firewalls
- ❌ Cannot reach internal networks
- ❌ No VPN access
- ✅ Can test public staging URLs

**Your System:**
- ✅ Access any internal app
- ✅ Works behind firewalls
- ✅ No internet needed
- ✅ Test localhost, internal domains, VPN-only apps

This is the **critical advantage** for your use case!

### 6. Model & AI Flexibility

**Propolis:**
- Uses proprietary or fixed models
- No choice in model size/quality
- Model updates controlled by them

**Your System:**
- Use any Ollama model:
  - llama3.2:1b (fast)
  - llama3.2:3b (balanced)
  - llama3.1:8b (high quality)
  - mistral, codellama, etc.
- Test with different models
- Update on your schedule

### 7. Integration Capabilities

**Propolis:**
- ✅ Built-in Slack notifications
- ✅ Built-in Linear/GitHub integration
- ✅ Webhook support
- ✅ API access

**Your System:**
- ➖ No built-in integrations (yet)
- ✅ Can add your own:
  ```python
  # Example: Add Slack integration
  async def notify_slack(findings):
      webhook_url = "your-slack-webhook"
      await post_to_slack(webhook_url, findings)
  ```
- ✅ Full programmatic access
- ✅ SQLite database for custom queries

## What You're Giving Up

By choosing the local system over Propolis, you **won't get**:

1. **Instant Setup**: Propolis is literally "paste URL, click start"
2. **Managed Infrastructure**: No maintenance, updates handled for you
3. **Built-in Integrations**: Slack/Linear/GitHub work out of box
4. **Multi-user Dashboard**: No web UI for team collaboration
5. **Unlimited Scale**: Can't spin up 100+ agents without hardware

## What You're Gaining

By choosing the local system, you **will get**:

1. **Internal App Access**: Test anything on your network
2. **Complete Privacy**: Data never leaves your infrastructure
3. **Zero Recurring Cost**: No per-test charges
4. **Full Customization**: Modify every aspect of agent behavior
5. **Model Flexibility**: Use any LLM, any size, any prompt
6. **Offline Operation**: No internet dependency
7. **Source Code Access**: Understand and modify everything
8. **Compliance Friendly**: Easier to pass security audits

## Propolis Architecture (Inferred)

```
Your Browser → Propolis Dashboard → Cloud Backend
                                        ├─ Agent Manager
                                        ├─ Browser Farm
                                        ├─ LLM Service (GPT-4/Claude?)
                                        └─ Database/Storage
                                              ↓
                                    Your Public App URL
```

**Problem**: Can't reach your internal app from cloud!

## Your System Architecture

```
Your Machine → Swarm Orchestrator → Local Agents
                                      ├─ Playwright Browsers
                                      ├─ Ollama (Local LLM)
                                      └─ SQLite Database
                                            ↓
                                    Your Internal App
                                    (localhost, .internal, behind VPN)
```

**Solution**: Everything runs locally, can access internal apps!

## Decision Matrix

Choose **Propolis** if you need:
- Zero setup time
- Public/staging apps only
- Built-in team collaboration
- Don't want to maintain anything
- Budget for SaaS tools

Choose **Your Local System** if you need:
- ✅ Internal/private app testing
- ✅ Complete data privacy
- ✅ No recurring costs
- ✅ Full customization
- ✅ Offline capability
- ✅ Compliance requirements

## Can You Use Both?

Yes! Consider:
- **Propolis**: For public staging/production sites
- **Your System**: For internal/dev environments

This gives you:
- Best of both worlds
- Defense in depth
- Coverage across all environments

## Migration Path

If you later want to use Propolis too:

1. **Keep your local system** for internal apps (they can't access anyway)
2. **Add Propolis** for public-facing apps if desired
3. **Compare results** between both systems
4. **Leverage learnings** from local system to better use Propolis

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform (Public)
- **Propolis**: ✅ Great choice
- **Local System**: ✅ Also works, but Propolis easier

### Scenario 2: Internal Admin Dashboard
- **Propolis**: ❌ Cannot access
- **Local System**: ✅ Perfect fit

### Scenario 3: API Documentation Site (Public)
- **Propolis**: ✅ Good choice
- **Local System**: ✅ Works, your call

### Scenario 4: Company Intranet
- **Propolis**: ❌ Cannot access
- **Local System**: ✅ Only option

### Scenario 5: Development Environment (localhost)
- **Propolis**: ❌ Cannot access
- **Local System**: ✅ Perfect fit

## Performance Comparison

### Test Speed

**Propolis:**
- Unlimited cloud resources
- Can run 100+ agents
- Distributed infrastructure
- Typical: 10-30 min for thorough test

**Your System:**
- Limited by your hardware
- 5-20 agents typical
- Single machine
- Typical: 10-30 min for thorough test

**Winner**: Propolis for scale, but difference minimal for most apps

### Report Quality

Both generate comprehensive reports with:
- Bug findings by severity
- Screenshots
- Reproduction steps
- Coverage metrics

**Winner**: Tie

## Conclusion

For your specific use case (internal web app, network-restricted):

**Your Local System is the clear winner** because:

1. ✅ **Only option that can access your app**
2. ✅ Keeps sensitive data private
3. ✅ No ongoing costs
4. ✅ Complete control
5. ✅ Works offline

Propolis is excellent for public apps, but cannot solve your specific problem.

## Final Recommendation

**Use the local system** you've built for:
- Internal applications
- Development environments
- Network-restricted apps
- Security-sensitive testing
- Learning and customization

**Consider Propolis later** if you:
- Launch public-facing apps
- Want a team dashboard
- Need built-in integrations
- Have budget for SaaS tools

---

**Bottom Line**: For internal web apps, the local system isn't just comparable to Propolis—it's the **only** solution that works!
